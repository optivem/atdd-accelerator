# ATDD Accelerator

The [ATDD Accelerator Program](https://atdd-accelerator.optivem.com/) was designed by [Valentina Jemuović](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valentinajemuovic/) to help Senior Engineers and Tech Leads adopt ATDD within 10 weeks. Through the program, our members get a chance to build their own Sandbox Project, receive review & feedback on their Sandbox Project. Then, they can take those learnings and apply them in their Real Life Project.
